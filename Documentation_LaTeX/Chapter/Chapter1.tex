\section {Introduction}

In my school project, I have worked on Forester. Currently, Forester don't have documentation and I have exchanged a lot of email with its authors. This document is a synthesis of this explanation and my experimentations.

Forester is an experimental tool for checking manipulation of dynamic data
structures using *\gls{FA}*. This tool can be loaded into *GCC* as a *plug-in*.  This
way you can easily analyse C code sources, using the existing build system,
without manually preprocessing them first. However, the analysis itself is not yet mature enough to be able to verify ordinary programs.
